IMPORTANT NOTES (Supplemental Table 2 in the Supporting Information also includes important comments related to these notes):

1) Input parameters

In the xml file ".../TNBC/TNBC_sim/resource/param_all.xml", there are sets of input parameters with comments "do not change" or "not used". 
The former refers to predefined parameters for the spQSP algorithm that should not be changed.
The latter refers to parameters that have been included but are not used for the calculations performed in this study. They are necessary for future expansions of the model (e.g. spatial variation of species such as CCL2 or Arg-I, 
addition of IL2 and IFNgamma, resection of the tumor, ipilimumab and other treatments, etc.). Some code lines for these future expansions have been also included, but the algorithm does not use them for this study.

2) Conditions to initialize ABM

In the code file ".../TNBC/SP_QSP_TNBC/abm/compartment/LymphCentral.cpp" there are two options to initialize ABM: 

(a) either QSP runs until an initial number of cancer cells is reached (by default in this version; used to avoid the presence of T cells and MDSCs when ABM is initialized)
(b) or until volume condition is met; if it is not met, it will show the message "tumor volume condition is not met" that means that the steady state has been reached

Case (a) only requires to introduce the input parameter "Param.QSP.simulation.init_cancer_cell" in the xml file ".../TNBC/TNBC_sim/resource/param_all.xml"
Case (b) requires to modify ".../TNBC/SP_QSP_TNBC/abm/compartment/LymphCentral.cpp":
      - Write // at the beginning of line 101
      - Remove // from lines 104 and 114-118
      - Optional: The diameter for the volume condition is the input "Param.QSP.init_value.Parameter.initial_tumour_diameter" in the xml file ".../TNBC/TNBC_sim/resource/param_all.xml" and can be redefined if necessary

3) Distribution of cancer cell when ABM is initialize

In the code file ".../TNBC/SP_QSP_TNBC/abm/compartment/VoxelContentGen.cpp" there are two options to initialize ABM: 

(a) Partial tumor (a quarter of a sliced tumor; by default in this version)
(b) Full tumor

Case (a) only requires to introduce the input parameters "Param.ABM.Environment.Tumor.mean_init_norm_dist" and "Param.ABM.Environment.Tumor.sd_init_norm_dist" in the xml file ".../TNBC/TNBC_sim/resource/param_all.xml"
For case (b):
      - Introduce the input parameters "Param.ABM.Environment.Tumor.mean_init_norm_dist" and "Param.ABM.Environment.Tumor.sd_init_norm_dist" in the xml file ".../TNBC/TNBC_sim/resource/param_all.xml"
      - Write // at the beginning of lines 56-61
      - Remove // from lines 41-52     

4) This spQSP extended version required to change the following lines in two of the shared code files from Gong's original spatial QSP model (https://github.com/popellab/SPQSP_IO/tree/main/SPQSP_IO/SP_QSP_shared/ABM_Base):

-   .../TNBC/SP_QSP_shared/ABM_Base/SpatialCompartment.h

Line 43 -> virtual void timeSlice(unsigned long slice, int cc, int teff, int treg, int mdsc, int texh)= 0;

By adding 'int cc, int teff, int treg, int mdsc, int texh' to the original line, the algorithm uses 'timeSlice' function to use the total number of cells in ABM (cancer cells, effector T cells, regulatory T cells, MDSCs, and exhausted T cells, respectively) at time t to estimate the number of cells at the next time step.
As explained in section 2.3 (QSP-ABM coupling) of the manuscript, the number of cells in ABM is necessary for scaling calculations every time step.

-   .../TNBC/SP_QSP_shared/ABM_Base/CellAgent.h

Line 43 -> virtual bool agent_state_step(double t, double dt, Coord& c, int cc_p, int teff_p, int treg_p, int mdsc_p, int texh_p) = 0;

Again, by adding 'int cc_p, int teff_p, int treg_p, int mdsc_p, int texh_p' to the original line, the algorithm uses 'agent_state_step' function to use the total number of cells in ABM (cancer cells, effector T cells, regulatory T cells, MDSCs, and exhausted T cells, respectively) at time t to estimate the number of cells at the next time step.
