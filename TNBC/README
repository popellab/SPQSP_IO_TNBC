Comments about the current state of the spQSP TNBC code

The following files include lines with values (here between $ symbols) that will be defined as input parameters in the next update. The values between $$ symbols below have been used to generate some of the invasive front results.

-	TNBC/SP_QSP_TNBC/abm/agent/TCell.cpp

Line 88 -> rng.get_unif_01() < params.getVal(PARAM_T_CELL_MOVE_PROB)/$6$ 


-	TNBC/SP_QSP_TNBC/abm/compartment/Tumor.cpp

Line 180 -> for (int I = 0; I < $111$; I++)

Lines 407-413 -> 
    		double p1 = $1$;
    		double p2 = $0.001$;
    		double p3 = $0.05$;
    		double a1 = $0.02$;
    		double a2 = $0$;
    		int min_cc = $-2$;
    		int max_cc = $2$;


-	TNBC/SP_QSP_TNBC/abm/compartment/LymphCentral.cpp

Line 107 -> while (ss_val[20] < $9.4e7$)


-	TNBC/SP_QSP_TNBC/abm/compartment/VoxelContentGen.cpp

Lines 64-65 ->     
double mean_dist = $0$ * params.getVal(PARAM_VOXEL_SIZE)/1e6;
    		double sd_dist = $15$ * params.getVal(PARAM_VOXEL_SIZE)/1e6;


-	TNBC/SP_QSP_TNBC/core/Param.cpp

Line 336 -> _paramFloatInternal[PARAM_CANCER_PROG_GROWTH_RATE] = $QP(14)$;


-	TNBC/TNBC_multi/TNBC_core.cpp

Line 260 -> double SC = $50000$;

Besides these modifications, this spQSP extended version required to change the following line in one of the shared code files from Gong's original version uploaded to :

-   SP_QSP_shared/ABM_Base/SpatialCompartment.h

Line 43 -> virtual void timeSlice(unsigned long slice, int cc, int teff, int treg, int mdsc, int texh)= 0;
