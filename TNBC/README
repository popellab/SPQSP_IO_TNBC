This spQSP extended version required to change the following lines in two of the shared code files from Gong's original spatial QSP model (https://github.com/popellab/SPQSP_IO/tree/main/SPQSP_IO/SP_QSP_shared/ABM_Base):

-   SP_QSP_shared/ABM_Base/SpatialCompartment.h

Line 43 -> virtual void timeSlice(unsigned long slice, int cc, int teff, int treg, int mdsc, int texh)= 0;

By adding 'int cc, int teff, int treg, int mdsc, int texh' to the original line, the algorithm uses 'timeSlice' function to use the total number of cells in ABM (cancer cells, effector T cells, regulatory T cells, MDSCs, and exhausted T cells, respectively) at time t to estimate the number of cells at the next time step.
As explained in section 2.3 (QSP-ABM coupling) of the manuscript, the number of cells in ABM is necessary for scaling calculations every time step.

-   SP_QSP_shared/ABM_Base/CellAgent.h

Line 43 -> virtual bool agent_state_step(double t, double dt, Coord& c, int cc_p, int teff_p, int treg_p, int mdsc_p, int texh_p) = 0;

Again, by adding 'int cc_p, int teff_p, int treg_p, int mdsc_p, int texh_p' to the original line, the algorithm uses 'agent_state_step' function to use the total number of cells in ABM (cancer cells, effector T cells, regulatory T cells, MDSCs, and exhausted T cells, respectively) at time t to estimate the number of cells at the next time step.
